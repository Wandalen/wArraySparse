Collection of routines to operate effectively sparse array. A sparse array is an vector of intervals which splits number space into two subsets, internal and external. ArraySparse leverage iterating, inverting, minimizing and other operations on a sparse array. Use the module to increase memory efficiency of your algorithms.
